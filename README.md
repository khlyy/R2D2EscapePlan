# R2D2EscapePlan
In this project, Search is used to help R2-D2 escape. The prison is an m * n grid
of cells. Some of the grid cells are occupied by unmovable obstacles. Luckily for R2-D2,
there is an inactivated teleportal (a device for instantaneous travel) in one of the grid
cells that can take it to the rebelâ€™s planet. However, R2-D2 can not use the teleportal
to escape unless it is activated. To activate the teleportal, R2-D2 has to push big rocks
onto pressure pads lying all around the grid. Each of the rocks and the pressure pads
occupies a single cell in the grid. When all the pressure pads have rocks pushed on top
of them, R2-D2 can head straight away to the activated teleportal to escape. R2-D2 can
only move in the four directions (north, south, east, and west) and push rocks around,
but it can not pass through or push the unmovable obstacles or the teleportal.
Using search we could be able to formulate a plan that R2-D2 can follow to escape. An optimal
plan is one with as few steps as possible. The following search algorithms are
implemented and each will be used to help R2-D2:
a) Breadth-first search.
b) Depth-first search.
c) Iterative deepening search.
d) Uniform-cost search.
e) Greedy search with at least two heuristics.
f) A* search with at least two admissible heuristics.
Each of these algorithms is tested and compared in terms of the number of
search tree nodes expanded. you can find more details in the project report and java docs.
